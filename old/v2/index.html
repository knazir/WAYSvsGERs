        <div class="title">The Evolution of General Education Requirements at Stanford University</div>
        <div class="intro">
            In 2013, Stanford introduced a new general education requirement called the Ways of Thinking/Ways of Doing that
            replaced its predecessor, the GERs (General Education Requirements). The biggest change between the two systems
            is the flexibility of courses that students could take. GERs focused on expanding the breadth of courses taken
            by students while WAYS focuses more on developing a “well-rounded toolkit of intellectual skills”. We want to
            explore how the new WAYS requirements affect students’ course planning and visualize the differences between
            WAYS and GERs. Specifically, we want to explore whether WAYS really did increase the flexibility of course
            choices for students and how the shift in requirements impacted enrollment for particular classes.

        <!-- Flexibility -->
        <header class="flexibility"><div>Flexibility</div></header>
        <div class="intro flexibility">
            We will first compare the flexibility between the GERs and WAYS system. For each requirement, we will
            measure flexibility by looking at the total number of courses that will fulfill that particular requirement
            and the departments that those courses belong to. We decided to use the courses from the 2013-2014 course
            catalog because that was the first year the WAYS system was implemented. Upperclassmen can decide if they
            want to stay on the GER system or switch to WAYS while freshmen will be required to fulfill WAYS
            requirements.

                    First we show the departmental makeup of each GER. Hover over a slice of the pie chart to see the
                    number of classes from a particular department.

                    <h4>WAYS Pies Depts</h4>
                    Now we show the departmental makeup of each WAYS requirement. Again, you can hover over a slice of
                    the pie chart to see the number of classes from a particular department. Compared to the GER pie
                    charts above, you can see that courses that fulfill WAYS requirements come from a larger variety
                    of departments.

                    You can also see the GER makeup of each WAYS requirement.

                    <h4>Comparison</h4>
                    Here is a side by side comparison of GERs vs WAYS. Based on our criteria for flexibility, it looks
                    like WAYS requirement did increase the flexibility of course choices for students.
