        <div class="title">The Evolution of General Education Requirements at Stanford University</div>
        <div class="intro">
            In 2013, Stanford introduced a new general education requirement called the Ways of Thinking/Ways of Doing
            that replaced its predecessor, the GERs (General Education Requirements). The biggest change between the
            two systems is the flexibility of courses that students could take. GERs focused on expanding the breadth
            of courses taken by students while WAYS focuses more on developing a ‚Äúwell-rounded toolkit of intellectual
            skills‚Äù. We want to explore how the new WAYS requirements affect students‚Äô course planning and visualize the
            differences between WAYS and GERs.<br/>
            <br/>
            Specifically, we want to explore whether WAYS really did increase the
            flexibility of course choices for students and how the shift in requirements impacted enrollment for
            particular classes.
            <br/>
            After having thoroughly examined the data, we decided to tell the story through 2 different perspectives:
            <strong>course flexibility</strong> and <strong>course enrollment</strong>.
        </div>

        <!-- Flexibility -->
        <header class="flexibility"><div>Flexibility</div></header>
        <div class="intro flexibility">
            We will first compare the flexibility between the GERs and WAYS. For each requirement, we will measure
            flexibility through the number of unique departments that make up a requirement as well as the number of
            courses within those departments.<br/>
            <br/>
            We will compare both systems at their respective ‚Äúheights‚Äù (2012-2013 for GERs and 2017-2018 for WAYS). We
            noticed that after WAYS were introduced, the number of GER courses and WAYS courses gradually decreased
            increased respectively over the next few years. Therefore, looking at these specific years paint a more
            accurate picture of the university‚Äôs ‚Äúideal‚Äù distributions for these general education systems.

                    <h4>Distribution of GERs</h4>
                    For the GER <em>Area Requirements</em>, students have to (1) take 5 Disciplinary Breadth (DB) courses,
                    one from each DB category and (2) take 2 courses in 2 different Education for Citizenship (EC) subject
                    areas. As we can see from the chart below, classes that satisfy the humanities requirement outnumber
                    math and social sciences combined. This is an interesting disparity as some could claim that humanities
                    majors have fewer choices in their natural science or engineering requirements while others could
                    conversely say that the system's flexibility is biased towards the humanities. The EC categories
                    have the lowest number of courses offered; however, students only have to choose 2 classes out of
                    the 4 categories.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-index="1">
                    <h4>Distribution of WAYS Requirements</h4>
                    The Ways program is comprised of 8 WAYS requirements. Students must take a total of 11
                    courses: 2 courses each in AII (Aesthetic and Interpretive Inquiry), SMA (Scientific Method and
                    Analysis), and SI (Social Inquiry); 1 course each in AQR (Applied Quantitative Reasoning), CE
                    (Creative Expression), ED (Engaging Diversity), ER (Ethical Reasoning), and FR (Formal Reasoning).
                    Similar to the GERs, there is an uneven distribution of the number of classes across the different
                    WAYS categories. Interestingly, students have to take 2 classes from the categories with the
                    smallest number of courses, SI and SMA. ü§î However, all is not as it seems. While there appears to
                    be bias towards what at first appear to be "humanities-related requirements," examining the
                    department makeup of these requirements tells another story.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-index="2">
                    <h4>Departmental Makeup of GERs</h4>
                    How many unique departments make up the GER requirements? More departments allow students greater
                    flexibility in their studies. DB-Humanities has the largest number of courses, and its courses are
                    scattered across an enormous 56 departments. DB-Math has the second largest number of courses,
                    but has the smallest number of departments at 11. The ‚ÄúOther‚Äù category includes all of the departments that make up less than 3.5% of the
                    total number of courses. The question is, how does this compare to WAYS?
                    (Hover over a slice of the donut chart to see the number of classes from a particular department,

                </div>
                <div class="step" data-index="3">
                    <h4>Departmental Makeup of WAYS Requirements</h4>
                    Compared to the GER department makeups above, we can see that the WAYS requirements seem to come
                    from a larger variety of departments. One of the biggest differences between GERs and WAYS is the
                    addition of the Creative Expression requirements, which includes courses from the
                    Theater and Performance Studies, Music, Dance, and Art Studio departments. Although the Ethical
                    Reasoning requirement is the only requirement to have persisted across the two programs,
                    it has evolved have a very different composition of departments. The GER EC-Ethical Reasoning had
                    104 classes across 19 departments, compared to WAYS-Ethical Reasoning, which includes 270 classes
                    across 46 departments. Itt looks like WAYS is working towards increased flexibility as advertised.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-index="4">
                    <h4>Comparison</h4>
                    When comparing the two systems directly, the results are surprisingly clear. In terms of
                    the average number of departments per requirement, average number of courses per requirement,
                    and overall number of courses offered in general, WAYS beats GERs hands down. The increases
                    are staggering, with WAYS seeing an enormous increase of 94.8% more courses per requirement
                    on average. From these, it's clear that the WAYS system has worked towards offering students
                    a larger variety in their choices by focusing less on specific areas of study and more on
                    developing specific skills.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-index="5">
                    <h4>GER Makeup of WAYS Requirements</h4>
                    Another way that we can explain this increased flexibility is by examining how GERs translated
                    into specific WAYS requirements. Below we have the makeup of each WAYS requirement in terms of
                    which GER courses were also given WAYS requirements when the new system was introduced. What's
                    surprising is that each requirement has courses from at least 4 different GERs, some like
                    SI even go up to 9. Additionally, many WAYS requirements have a large portion of "New" classes
                    that did not previously satisfy a GER requirement. Looking at it this way, it appears that
                    WAYS has both increased the volume of classes that satisfy requirements while also
                    mixing-and-matching between the original GER requirements to improve course flexibility.

            Another metric we used to examine the effectiveness of the new WAYS systems was the course enrollment data.
            We have tracked significant changes in enrollment for two categories of classes:
            <ol>
                <li>Classes that satisfied GERs but were not converted to satisfy any WAYS requirements</li>
                <li>Classes that satisfied no GERs but satisfy WAYS requirements.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <section class="enrollment">
            <div class="text">
                <div class="step" data-index="0">
                    <h4>GER classes that do not fulfill any WAYS requirements</h4>
                    Many classes were not given a WAYS requirement with the new system, Many of these experienced a
                    non-trivial decrease in enrollment after the introduction of WAYS. Take CEE176B:
                    Electric Power: Renewables and Efficiency for example. Originally, this class
                    fulfilled the DB-EngrAppSci requirement, but its enrollment dropped by 33% within a year of the new
                    system and over 50% by 2017. Enrollment data can give us insights into classes that students may
                    have been taking only to satisfy requirements.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Below you can explore changes in enrollment for classes that fulfilled GERs but
                    were not converted to satisfy any WAYS requirements. Use the input and dropdowns at the top to
                    filter out classes with less than a percentage change in enrollment between two years. Use negative
                    percentages for decreases in enrollment.
                    Click on a series (or overlapping series) in the chart to focus on those courses. You can also
                    see a breakdown of what GERs the displayed courses satisfy on the right. After focusing a
                    single course, you can see more specific details about that course as well as a link to its Carta

                    <h4>WAYS classes that did not fulfill a GER requirement</h4>
                    In this case, we're examining classes that did not originally satisfy GERs but do satisfy a WAYS
                    requirement. Interestingly, between 2013-2016, the class with the largest
                    increase in enrollment is MS&E193, which fulfills multiple WAYS requirements as well as a
                    Technology in Society requirement for engineering students. Many CE and SI courses also experienced
                    large increases in enrollment after the change from GERs to WAYS as these were classes that
                    did not originally fulfill any requirements under the GERs. We could say that little-to-no increase
                    in the number of classes that increased in enrollment after the introduction of WAYS is positive.
                    This is because if enrollment doesn't spike, then we could assume that while GERs forced students
                    to take classes in specific departments, WAYS allows students greater flexibility with more
                    options to choose from
