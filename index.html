        <div class="title">The Evolution of General Education Requirements at Stanford University</div>
        <div class="intro">
            In 2013, Stanford introduced a new general education requirement called the Ways of Thinking/Ways of Doing
            that replaced its predecessor, the GERs (General Education Requirements). The biggest change between the
            two systems is the flexibility of courses that students could take. GERs focused on expanding the breadth
            of courses taken by students while WAYS focuses more on developing a “well-rounded toolkit of intellectual
            skills”. We want to explore how the new WAYS requirements affect students’ course planning and visualize the
            differences between WAYS and GERs. Specifically, we want to explore whether WAYS really did increase the
            flexibility of course choices for students and how the shift in requirements impacted enrollment for
            particular classes.
            <br/>
            After having thoroughly examined the data, we decided to tell the story through 2 different perspectives:
            Course flexibility and enrollment.
        </div>

        <!-- Flexibility -->
        <header class="flexibility"><div>Flexibility</div></header>
        <div class="intro flexibility">
            We will first compare the flexibility between the GERs and WAYS. For each requirement, we will measure
            flexibility through the number of unique departments that make up a requirement as well as the number of
            courses within those departments.<br/>
            <br/>
            We will compare both systems at their respective “heights” (2012-2013 for GERs and 2017-2018 for WAYS). We
            noticed that after WAYS were introduced, the number of GER courses decreased and the number of WAYS courses
            increased over the next few years. Therefore, looking at these specific years paint a more accurate picture
            of the university’s “ideal” distribution for these general education systems.

                    <h4>Departmental Makeup of GERs</h4>
                    First we show the departmental makeup of each GER. Hover over a slice of the pie chart to see the
                    number of classes from a particular department.

                    <h4>Departmental Makeup of WAYS Requirements</h4>
                    Now we show the departmental makeup of each WAYS requirement. Again, you can hover over a slice of
                    the pie chart to see the number of classes from a particular department. Compared to the GER pie
                    charts above, you can see that courses that fulfill WAYS requirements come from a larger variety
                    of departments.

                    <h4>Comparison</h4>
                    Here is a side by side comparison of GERs vs WAYS. Based on our criteria for flexibility, it looks
                    like WAYS requirement did increase the flexibility of course choices for students.

            Another metric we used to examine the effectiveness of the new WAYS systems was the course enrollment data.
            We have tracked significant change in enrollment for two categories of classes: (1) Classes that satisfied
            GERs but were not converted to satisfy any WAYS requirements and (2) Classes that satisfied no GERs but
            were made to satisfy WAYS requirements.

            We will first compare the flexibility between the GERs and WAYS system. For each requirement, we will
            measure flexibility by looking at the total number of courses that will fulfill that particular requirement
            and the departments that those courses belong to. We decided to use the courses from the 2013-2014 course
            catalog because that was the first year the WAYS system was implemented. Upperclassmen can decide if they
            want to stay on the GER system or switch to WAYS while freshmen will be required to fulfill WAYS
            requirements.
