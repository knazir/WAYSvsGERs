        <div class="title">The Evolution of General Education Requirements at Stanford University</div>
        <div class="intro">
            In 2013, Stanford introduced a new general education requirement called the Ways of Thinking/Ways of Doing
            that replaced its predecessor, the GERs (General Education Requirements). The biggest change between the
            two systems is the flexibility of courses that students could take. GERs focused on expanding the breadth
            of courses taken by students while WAYS focuses more on developing a ‚Äúwell-rounded toolkit of intellectual
            skills‚Äù. We want to explore how the new WAYS requirements affect students‚Äô course planning and visualize the
            differences between WAYS and GERs. Specifically, we want to explore whether WAYS really did increase the
            flexibility of course choices for students and how the shift in requirements impacted enrollment for
            particular classes.
            <br/>
            After having thoroughly examined the data, we decided to tell the story through 2 different perspectives:
            Course flexibility and enrollment.
        </div>

        <!-- Flexibility -->
        <header class="flexibility"><div>Flexibility</div></header>
        <div class="intro flexibility">
            We will first compare the flexibility between the GERs and WAYS. For each requirement, we will measure
            flexibility through the number of unique departments that make up a requirement as well as the number of
            courses within those departments.<br/>
            <br/>
            We will compare both systems at their respective ‚Äúheights‚Äù (2012-2013 for GERs and 2017-2018 for WAYS). We
            noticed that after WAYS were introduced, the number of GER courses decreased and the number of WAYS courses
            increased over the next few years. Therefore, looking at these specific years paint a more accurate picture
            of the university‚Äôs ‚Äúideal‚Äù distribution for these general education systems.

                    <h4>Distribution of GERs</h4>
                    For the GER Area Requirements, students have to 1) take 5 Disciplinary Breadth (DB) courses, one
                    from each DB category and 2) take 2 courses in 2 different Education for Citizenship (EC) subject
                    areas. As we can see from the chart below, classes that satisfy the humanities requirement outnumber
                    math and social sciences combined. The EC categories have the lowest number of courses offered;
                    however, students only have to choose 2 classes out of the 4 categories.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-index="1">
                    <h4>Distribution of WAYS Requirements</h4>
                    The Ways program is comprised of eight Ways requirements. Students must take a total of eleven
                    courses: 2 courses each in AII (Aesthetic and Interpretive Inquiry), SMA (Scientific Method and
                    Analysis), and SI (Social Inquiry); 1 course each in AQR (Applied Quantitative Reasoning), CE
                    (Creative Expression), ED (Engaging Diversity), ER (Ethical Reasoning), and FR (Formal Reasoning).
                    Similar to the GERs, there is an uneven distribution of the number of classes across the different
                    WAYS categories. Interestingly, students have to take 2 classes from the categories with the
                    smallest number of courses, SI and SMA. ü§î

                <div class="step" data-index="2">
                    <h4>Departmental Makeup of GERs</h4>
                    DB-Humanities has the largest number of courses, and its courses are scattered across a huge variety
                    of departments. DB-Math has the second largest number of courses, but has the smallest number of
                    departments. The ‚ÄúOther‚Äù category includes all of the departments that make up less than 3.5% of the
                    total number of courses. (Hover over a slice of the donut chart to see the number of classes from a
                    particular department. Click on the donut chart to enlarge).

                <div class="step" data-index="3">
                    <h4>Departmental Makeup of WAYS Requirements</h4>
                    Compared to the DER donut charts above, WAYS requirements seem to come from a larger variety of
                    departments. The biggest difference between GERs and WAYS is the addition of the Creative Expression
                    requirements, which includes courses from the Theater and Performance Studies, Music, Dance, and
                    Art Studio departments. Although the ethical reasoning requirement is the only requirement to have
                    persisted across the two programs, it has evolved have a very different composition of departments.
                    The GER EC-Ethical Reasoning had 104 classes across 19 departments, compared to WAYS-Ethical
                    Reasoning, which includes 270 classes across 46 departments.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-index="4">
                    <h4>Comparison</h4>
                    Since there are more WAYS courses than GER courses and WAYS requirements are found in a larger
                    number of departments, it looks like the WAYS system did increase the flexibility of course
                    choices for students.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-index="5">
                    <h4>GER Makeup of WAYS Requirements</h4>
                    For all of the WAYS categories, the majority of classes are ‚ÄúNew‚Äù, which are classes that were not
                    previously GERs. Again, this shows that CE was the largest difference between GERs and WAYS
                    requirements.

        <!-- Enrollment -->
        <header class="enrollment"><div>Enrollment</div></header>
        <div class="intro enrollment">
            Another metric we used to examine the effectiveness of the new WAYS systems was the course enrollment data.
            We have tracked significant change in enrollment for two categories of classes:
            <ol>
                <li>Classes that satisfied GERs but were not converted to satisfy any WAYS requirements</li>
                <li>Classes that satisfied no GERs but were made to satisfy WAYS requirements.</li>
            </ol>

                <div class="step" data-index="0">
                    <h4>GER classes that do not fulfill any WAYS requirements</h4>
                    You can adjust the number of classes shown in the chart by selecting the minimum percent decrease in
                    enrollment from 2012-2017. It seems like many of the classes that experienced a sharp decline were
                    DB-EngrAppSci courses (Hover over a line to see the enrollment change for a particular course).

                    <h4>No GERs -> WAYS</h4>
                    Again, you can adjust the number of classes shown in the chart by selecting the minimum percent
                    increase in enrollment from 2012-2017. Interestingly, between 2013-2016, the class with the largest
                    increase in enrollment is MS&E 193, which fulfills multiple WAYS requirements as well as a
                    Technology in Society requirement for engineering students. Many CE and SI courses also experienced
                    large increases in enrollment after the change from GERs to WAYS.
